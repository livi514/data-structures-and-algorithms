Simulation Report: Implementing Lift Systems Using LOOK and SCAN Algorithms

Scenarios to test:

1. Getting each algorithm to transport one person from the ground floor to the top floor.
How to run this test:
- Set the top floor to be floor 10. Do not enter any new requests while the lift is travelling. 
- Can try this with other values for the top floor as well, to make sure it works for all possible values.
Expected results:
- Both lifts should travel all the way to the top floor, the person should get off (capacity limits etc. should be adjusted accordingly), and the lift direction should be changed to down.
- Both algorithms should be equally efficient, provided that the time spend travelling between one floor to the other is the same for each.

2. Getting each algorithm to transport one person to a floor other than the top floor.
How to run this test:
- Set the top floor to have a higher value than the requested floor.
- E.g. set the top floor to 10, and the request to 7.
- Do not enter any new requests while the lift is travelling.
- the scan lift should still travel all the way to the top floor
- the look lift should travel to the requested floor, then change direction as there are no more requests in the current direction 

3. Getting the algorithm to handle multiple requests in the same direction, including the top floor.
- e.g. starting from the bottom floor, requests floors 3, 6, 10, with the top floor being 10
- both of the lifts should stop at each floor then change direction to "down" at the top floor

4. Getting the algorithm to handle multiple requests in the same direction, not including the top floor.
- e.g. starting from the bottom floor, requests floors 3, 6, 8, with the top floor being 10
- the scan lift should still travel all the way to the top floor
- the look lift should switch direction to "down" after servicing the request at floor 9

I'll have to change these so that they take into account the input files.
Real-time request handling is no longer a requirement, however, we can implement it for extra marks.
If we decide to implement some real-time request handling, then we would have to make some scenarios to test this.
I'll add some scenarios that test the capacity limits as well.
