Important things to consider:

- How to implement different priority levels 
- What will priority be based on?
    - e.g. the amount of time people have been waiting for?
    - is there anything else we should consider?
    - it would be inefficient to JUST go off based on priorities and dart all over the place 
- Capacity
    - Based on total weight?
